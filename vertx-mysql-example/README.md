## MySQL example

This example requires that you have a mysql db installed somewhere

It assumes the db is installed on `localhost` and has a db called `vertx` which contains a table `messages` containing a `name` field and a `message` field.

It also assumes the username and password for this database is `test`

If this is not the case with your setup, all these things can be altered in the config section at the bottom of `app.js`
